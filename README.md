# burger-logger
This page is created to sort burgers that have been eaten and that have not been. ALthough this app has no purpose other than to be fun, it did help me with my knowledge about how front end and back end communicate with one another. The folder structure that brought the orm to the front end appeared complicated to me at first, but as I dove in deeper i was able to see figure out how it all sends data to one another harmoneously, both pulling and pushing to the mysql from the front end input pages. I hope to add to this knowledge as I move forwad from handlebars.
